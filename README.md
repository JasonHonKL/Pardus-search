# Pardus-search
This library is a search cache library. The purpose of this library is to enhance the user experience when using Pardus search. The goal is to create a cache room and return an ID. If the search is deemed highly relevant, we won't conduct further searches and will instead use the cached search result.

## Idea & Workflow
The idea is that searches can take a long time, and we want to speed things up. To minimize the trade-off, we created this library to ensure that the search process is more efficient.

This will be crucial for achieving lightning-fast searches with Pardus search.

## License
We use the GNU License for several reasons:
- We have invested significant time in optimizing the search, and we hope to improve this with the community's help.
- We believe open source can accelerate AI development, and we love to contribute.
- Therefore, we hope that those who use this library will also open source their projects and contribute to the community.
